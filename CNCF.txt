Hi Asahi,
Thank you for your patience. You are welcome to use photos from the Flickr album with a link and proper credit to CNCF. Thank you for double checking. 
Our registration terms and conditions inform attendees that photos and videos may be taken, and they have the option to opt out. Once the images are publicly available in the Flickr album, they can be used by the community—provided the usage aligns with our Code of Conduct.
Thanks,
Tin Matienzo

Hi Asahi, 
Thank you for your patience. We understand you’re planning to share photos of slides in your upcoming article about KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan 2025.
Please note that PowerPoint slides are sometimes made available by speakers in the event schedule, at their discretion. If the slides are publicly shared there, you’re welcome to include photos of them in your article - just be sure to credit the speaker appropriately.
If the slides are not available through the schedule, we recommend refraining from sharing those photos publicly.
Additionally, we encourage you to use images from our official Flickr album and credit CNCF when doing so.
Let us know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Tin Matienzo
CNCF Events Team
